\subsection*{Background}
%Let $G$ be a finitely presented group with \textbf{generators} $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ and \textbf{relators} $r_1 = e$, $r_2 = e$, \ldots, $r_m = e$. For each generator $x_i$ there is a corresponding inverse $x_i^{-1}$. A \textbf{word} in $G$ is a finite string made of the symbols $x_i$ and $x_i^{-1}$. The empty string $e$ is a word that will serve as the identity element. Each relator $r_i$ is a word. 
A \textbf{finitely presented group} is specified by the following data.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Generators} $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$. Just a set of symbols.
	\item \textbf{Relators} $r_1 = e$, $r_2 = e$, \ldots, $r_m = e$. More on these in a moment.
\end{enumerate}

\indent For each generator $x_i$ there is a corresponding inverse, $x_i^{-1}$. A \textbf{word} is just a finite string made of the symbols $x_i$ and $x_i^{-1}$. The empty string $e$ is a word and will be the identity element in $G$. The relators are words.\\
\indent $G$ consists of all \textit{equivalence classes} of words, where two words $u$ and $v$ are equivalent if $u$ can be transformed into $v$ by a finite sequence of cancellations or eliminating/introducing relators.\\
\indent Equivalently, $G$ is a quotient of the free group on the generators modulo the normal closure of the relators. 

\subsection*{The Word Problem}
The \textbf{word problem} is the decision problem that asks whether two words $u$ and $v$ are equivalent in $G$. In some finitely presented groups this is straight up \textbf{undecidable} -- it is provably impossible to give an algorithm that always outputs a correct answer.

\subsection*{The Conjugacy Problem}
The \textbf{conjugacy problem} is the decision problem that asks whether two words $u$ and $v$ are \textbf{conjugate} in $G$. In other words, it asks whether there exists a word $w$ such that $u = wvw^{-1}$.
