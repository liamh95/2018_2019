\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Prove that every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.
		\begin{proof}
			Let $G$ be a cyclic group. First, suppose that $G$ is of infinite order. Then sending the generator of $G$ to $1\in \integers$ gives an isomorphism $G\cong \integers$. We claim that every subgroup of $\integers$ is of the form $n\integers$, which is clearly cyclic. Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ and let $n$ be the smallest positive integer in $H$. Then $n\integers \subseteq H$. Suppose the containment is strict and let $m$ be the smallest positive integer in $H\setminus n\integers$. We then have that $1\leq \gcd(m,n)<n$ and by Bezout's identity we have that $\gcd(m,n) = um+vn$ for some $u,v\in \integers$ is in $H$. But this contradicts the minimality of $n$, so we conclude that $H= n\integers$.\\

			\noindent Suppose now that $G = \langle g\rangle$ is finite of order $n$ so that $G\cong \integers/n\integers$. By the fourth isomorphism theorem (or lattice/correspondence theorem) there is a one-to-one correspondence between subgroups of $\integers/n\integers$ and subgroups of $\integers$ containing $n\integers$. We have already shown that all subgroups of $\integers$ are cyclic, and since the homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic ($\varphi(g^k) = \varphi(g)^k$), we have that all subgroups of $\integers/n\integers$ are cyclic.
		\end{proof}

		\item Is the automorphism group of a cyclic group necessarily cyclic?
		\begin{solution}
			This need not be the case. Let $G \cong \integers/N\integers$. As $G$ is cyclic, any automorphism of $G$ is determined by where it sends a generator and it must map a generator to a generator. The generators of $\integers/N\integers$ exactly correspond to the elements of $(\integers/N\integers)^\times$ and we have that $\Aut(\integers/N\integers) \cong (\integers/N\integers)^\times$. If $N$ is a product of distinct primes $p, q>2$ then the Chinese remainder theorem says that
			\[
			(\integers/N\integers)^\times \cong (\integers/p\integers)^\times \times (\integers/q\integers)^\times \cong \integers/(p-1)\integers \times \integers/(q-1)\integers,
			\]
			which is not cyclic
		\end{solution}
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Let $G = \integers/25\integers$ be the cyclic group of order 25.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Can $G$ be given the structure of a $\integers[i]$-module?
		\begin{solution}
			Yes it can. Observe that in $\integers/25\integers$, $-1 = 24 = 6\cdot 4 = 9^2\cdot 2^2$, so $18^2 = -1$. Define the action of $a+bi\in \integers[i]$ on $m\in \integers/25\integers$ by 
			\[
			(a+bi)\cdot m = (a+18b)m.
			\]
			This action gives $G$ the structure of a $\integers[i]$-module since
			\begin{align*}
				[(a+bi)+(c+di)]\cdot m &= [(a+c)+(b+d)i]\cdot m\\
				&= [(a+c)+18(b+d)]m\\
				&= (a+bi)\cdot m + (c+di)\cdot m.\\
				(a+bi)\cdot (m+n) &= (a+18b)(m+n)\\
				&= (a+bi)\cdot m + (a+bi)\cdot n.\\
				[(a+bi)(c+di)]\cdot m&= [(ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i]m\\
				&= [(ac-bd)+18(ad+bc)]m\\
				&= (a+bi)\cdot [(c+di)\cdot m].
			\end{align*}
		\end{solution}
		\item Can $G$ be given the structure of a $\integers/5\integers$ module?
		\begin{solution}
			No it cannot. If it could then we would have
			\begin{align*}
				0 &= 0\cdot 1\\
				&= 5\cdot 1\\
				&= (1+1+1+1+1)\cdot 1\\
				&= 1\cdot 1 + 1\cdot 1 + 1\cdot 1+1\cdot 1 + 1\cdot 1\\
				&= 5\\
				&\neq 0.
			\end{align*}
		\end{solution}
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Prove that there is no simple group of order 520.
	\begin{proof}
		Write $520 = 2^3\cdot 5\cdot 13$. By Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow-5 subgroups, $n_5$ is 1 mod 5 and divides $2^3\cdot 13 = 104$. The only positive integers satisfying these constraints are 1 and 26. The same reasoning shows that $n_{13}$ must be 1 or 40. If either of $n_5$ or $n_{13}$ is 1, then since Sylow-$p$ subgroups are conjugate to one another, then that subgroup would be normal. Suppose then that $n_5 = 26$ and $n_{13} = 40$. Then there are $26\cdot 4 = 104$ elements of order 5 and $40\cdot 12 = 480$ elements of order 13. But $104+480 = 584 > 520$, so this cannot be the case. We conclude that there must be a unique Sylow-5 or Sylow-13 subgroup which is normal.
	\end{proof}

	\item Let $G$ be a finite group acting transitively on a set $X$ with $|X|>1$.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item State the orbit-stabilizer theorem.
		\begin{solution}
			If a group $G$ acts on a set $X$ then for any $x\in X$, the size of the orbit of $x$ under $G$ is the index of the stabilizer of $x$ under $G$, $|\mcal{O}(x)| = [G: \text{Stab}(x)]$.
		\end{solution}
		\item Show that there is some element of $G$ fixing no element of $X$.
		\begin{proof}
			Since the action of $G$ on $X$ is transitive there is a single orbit. Burnside's lemma (which immediately follows from the orbit-stabilizer theorem) then states that
			\[
			1 = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}|\{x\in X: g\cdot x = x\}|.
			\]
			If $g\in G$ has fixed points then it contributes at least $1/|G|$ to the above sum. If \textit{every} element has a fixed point then we must have that every term in the sum is $1/|G|$. But the identity element fixes every element in $X$ and $|X|>1$, so we must have that one term in this sum is zero, i.e. at least one element of $G$ is fixed point free.
		\end{proof}
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Let $K$ be a field and let $\overline{K}$ be an algebraic closure of $K$. Assume $\alpha,\beta\in \overline{K}$ have degree 2 and 3 over $K$, respectively.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Can $\alpha\beta$ have degree 5 over $K$?
		\begin{solution}
			No it cannot. We have that $K(\alpha\beta)$ is contained in the composite extension $K(\alpha)K(\beta)$. Furthermore, since the degrees of $K(\alpha)$ and $K(\beta)$ over $K$ are relatively prime, we have that the composite extension has degree 6 over $K$. Since $K(\alpha\beta)$ is a subfield of the composite extension, its degree over $K$ must divide 6. Since 5 doesn't divide 6 we have that $K(\alpha\beta)$ cannot have degree 5 over $K$.
		\end{solution}
		\item Can $\alpha\beta$ have degree 6 over $K$?
		\begin{solution}
			Yes it can. Consider $\rationals(\sqrt{2})$ and $\rationals(\sqrt[3]{2})$. $x^2-2$ and $x^3-2$ are irreducible over $\rationals$ by Eisenstein so these extensions are of degree 2 and 3, respectively. We claim that the product $2^{1/2}\cdot 2^{1/3} = 2^{5/6}$ has degree 6 over $\rationals$.\\

			\noindent We start by showing that $\rationals(2^{5/6}) = \rationals(2^{1/6})$. Clearly $\rationals(2^{5/6})\subseteq \rationals(2^{1/6})$. On the other hand, $\frac{1}{2^4}(2^{5/6})^5 = 2^{1/6}$, so $\rationals(2^{1/6})\subseteq \rationals(2^{5/6})$. Finally, $2^{1/6}$ is a root of the polynomial $x^6-2$, which is irreducible over $\rationals$ by Eisenstein, so we have that $2^{1/6}$, and therefore $2^{5/6}$, has degree 6 over $\rationals$.
		\end{solution}
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Let $L/\rationals$ denote a Galois extension with Galois group isomorphic to $A_4$.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Does there exist a quadratic extension $K/\rationals$ contained in $L$?
		\begin{solution}
			By the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, a quadratic extension $K/\rationals$ corresponds to a subgroup of $\Gal(L/\rationals)\cong A_4$ of index 2 (order 6). We claim that there is no such subgroup, and therefore no such quadratic sub-extension.\\

			\noindent Any group of order 6 is isomorphic to either $\integers/6\integers$ or $S_3$. $A_4$ consists of double 2-cycles, e.g. $(1\ 2)(3\ 4)$, and 3-cycles, e.g. $(1\ 2\ 3)$, none of which have order 6, so that leaves $S_3$. $S_3$ has three elements of order 2, and since the three double 2-cycles in $A_4$ are exactly its elements of order 2, they must all lie in any subgroup isomorphic to $S_3$. However, the elements of order 2 don't commute with one another in $S_3$ while they do in $A_4$, so we cannot have a subgroup of $A_4$ isomorphic to $S_3$.
		\end{solution}
		\item Does there exist a degree 4 polynomial in $\rationals[x]$ with splitting field equal to $L$?
		\begin{solution}
			
		\end{solution}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Let $A: V\to V$ be a linear transformation of a vector space $V$ over the field $\rationals$ which satisfies the relation $(A^3+3I)(A^3-2I)=0$. Show that the dimension $\dim_\rationals(V)$ is divisible by 3.
	\begin{proof}
		Since $A$ satisfies the polynomial $(x^3+3)(x^3-2)$, the minimal polynomial of $A$ over $\rationals$ must divide $(x^3+3)(x^3-2)$. Since $x^3+3$ and $x^3-2$ are both irreducible over $\rationals$ by Eisenstein, the minimal polynomial must be either $x^3+3$, $x^3-2$ or $(x^3+3)(x^3-2)$. Furthermore, the minimal polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial whose degree is the dimension of $V$ over $\rationals$. Since the minimal polynomial and characteristic polynomial have the same roots in an algebraic closure, we must have that the characteristic polynomial is of the form $(x^3+3)^a(x^3-2)^b$ for some nonnegative integers $a,b$ at least one of which is positive. Since the degree of such a polynomial is divisible by 3, we must have that the dimension of $V$ over $\rationals$ is divisible by 3.
	\end{proof}

	\item True/False.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item If $K_1$, $K_2$ are fields and $\varphi: K_1\to K_2$ is a ring homomorphism such that $\varphi(1)=1$, then $\varphi$ is injective.
		\begin{solution}
			True. The kernel of $\varphi$ is an ideal in $K_1$. Since $K_1$ is a field its only ideals are $(0)$ and all of $K_1$. Since $\varphi(1) = 1$, we have that the kernel of $\varphi$ is not all of $K_1$, so it must be trivial, forcing $\varphi$ to be injective.
		\end{solution}
		\item The unit group of $\complex$ is isomorphic to the additive group of $\complex$.
		\begin{solution}
			Assuming ``the unit group of $\complex$'' means the nonzero complex numbers, $\complex^\times$, then this is false. $\complex^\times$ contains an element of order 2, $-1$, whereas the additive group $(\complex, +)$ contains no elements of order 2.
		\end{solution}
		\item Let $n$ be a positive integer. Then $\integers/n\integers\otimes_\integers\rationals = 0$.
		\begin{solution}
			True. For any simple tensor $a\otimes \frac{p}{q}$ in $\integers/n\integers\otimes_\integers \rationals$ we have
			\begin{align*}
				a\otimes \frac{p}{q} &= a\otimes \frac{np}{nq}\\
				&= na\otimes \frac{p}{nq}\\
				&= 0\otimes \frac{p}{nq}\\
				&= 0.
			\end{align*}
		\end{solution}
	\end{enumerate}

	\item For each of the following either give an example or show that none exists.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item An element $\alpha\in \rationals(\sqrt{2}, i)$ such that $\rationals(\alpha)= \rationals(\sqrt{2}, i)$.
		\begin{solution}
			As this is a finite extension of $\rationals$ and since any such extension is separable as $\rationals$ is perfect, the primitive element theorem guarantees the existence of such an $\alpha$. We claim that $\rationals(\sqrt{2}, i) = \rationals(\sqrt{2}+i)$. The inclusion $\rationals(\sqrt{2}+i)\subseteq \rationals(\sqrt{2}, i)$ is obvious. Note that $(\sqrt{2}+i)^3 = -\sqrt{2}+5i$. This gives
			\[
			(\sqrt{2}+i)^3 + (\sqrt{2}+i) = 6i,
			\]
			so $i\in \rationals(\sqrt{2}+i)$. Subtracting $i$ from $\sqrt{2}+i$ shows that $\sqrt{2}\in \rationals(\sqrt{2}+i)$ as well and we have the reverse inclusion.
		\end{solution}
		\item A tower of field extensions $L\supseteq K'\supseteq K$ such that $L/K'$ and $K'/K$ are Galois extensions but $L/K$ is not Galois.
		\begin{solution}
			Consider the extensions $\rationals(\sqrt{2})/\rationals$ and $\rationals(\sqrt[4]{2})/\rationals(\sqrt{2})$. Both of these extensions are Galois since they are quadratic. However, $\rationals(\sqrt[4]{2})/\rationals$ is not Galois because it doesn't contain the non-real roots of $x^4-2$.
		\end{solution}
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Let $L_1, \ldots, L_r$ be all pairwise non-isomorphic complex irreducible representations of a group $G$ of order 12. What are the possible values for their dimensions $n_i = \dim_\complex L_i$? For each of the possible answers of the form $(n_1, \ldots, n_r)$ give an example of $G$ which has such irreducible representations.
	\begin{solution}
		We have that $n_1^2 + \cdots + n_r^2 = 12$ and that $r$ is the number of conjugacy classes in $G$. Since the one-dimensional trivial representation is always a representation of $G$, we know that at least one of the $n_i$ is 1. We also know that the number of conjugacy classes divides the order of $G$ by Lagrange's theorem. These constraints give us three possible configurations of the $n_i$:
		\[
		(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)\quad (1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2)\quad (1, 1, 1, 3).
		\]
		Here are some examples from each class.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[$(1, \ldots, 1)$:]The irreducible representations of an abelian group are all one-dimensional, so a group like $\integers/12\integers$ would fall into this category.

			\item[$(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2)$:] We can safely place the dihedral group $D_{12}$ in this category because it has six conjugacy classes and this is the only configuration of the $n_i$ consistent with this.

			\item[$(1, 1, 1, 3)$:] The alternating group $A_4$ is in this category because it has four conjugacy classes.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Fall 2015}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \begin{enumerate}
		\item Define \textbf{prime ideal}.
		\begin{solution}
			An ideal $P\neq R$ of the commutative ring $R$ is prime if $ab\in R$ implies that $a\in R$ or $b\in R$. Equivalently, $P$ is prime if and only if $R/P$ is an integral domain.
		\end{solution}
		\item Define \textbf{maximal ideal}.
		\begin{solution}
			An ideal $I\neq R$ of the ring $R$ is maximal if $I$ is not properly contained in another ideal (that isn't all of $R$). If $R$ is commutative, then $I$ is maximal if and only if $R/I$ is a field.
		\end{solution}
		\item Give an example of a ring $R$ and ideal $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ of $R$ such that for the properties ``prime ideal'' and ``maximal ideal'' of $R$,
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $P_1$ satisfies both properties,
			\item $P_2$ satisfies neither property
			\item $P_3$ satisfies one property but not the other.
		\end{enumerate}
		\begin{solution}
			Let $R = \rationals[x,y]$. The ideal $P_1 = (x,y)$ is maximal since $R/P_1 = \rationals$, which is a field. Since all fields are integral domains, we have that $P_1$ is prime as well.\\

			\noindent The ideal $P_2 = (x^2)$ is not prime since $x\cdot x$ is in $P_2$ but $x$ is not. Since maximal ideals are always prime, this shows that $P_2$ isn't maximal either.\\

			\noindent The ideal $P_3 = (x)$ is prime but not maximal since $R/P_3 = \rationals[y]$, which is an integral domain but not a field.
		\end{solution}
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Show that if a group $G$ has only finitely many subgroups then $G$ is a finite group.
	\begin{proof}
		Suppose $G$ is an infinite group. If $G$ has an element $g$ of infinite order then $\langle g\rangle\cong \integers$, which has infinitely many subgroups. Suppose then that every element of $G$ has finite order. Since $G = \cup_{g\in G}\langle g\rangle$ and every $\langle g\rangle$ is a finite set, the only way to cover the infinite set $G$ by finite sets $\langle g\rangle$ is to have infinitely many distinct $\langle g\rangle$. Thus, an infinite group must have infinitely many subgroups, so a group with finitely many subgroups must be finite.
	\end{proof}

	\item Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix with entires in $\reals$ such that $A^2 = -I$.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Prove that $n$ is even.
		\begin{proof}
			Since $A$ satisfies the polynomial $x^2+1$, its minimal polynomial over $\mathbb{R}$ must divide $x^2+1$. This polynomial is irreducible over $\mathbb{R}$ and since the minimal polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial and both polynomials have the same roots in $\complex$, the characteristic polynomial must be $(x^2+1)^d$ for some $d\geq 1$. The degree of the characteristic polynomial, $2d$, is $n$, so $n$ is even.
		\end{proof}
		\item Prove that $A$ is diagonalizable over $\complex$ and describe the corresponding diagonal matrices.
		\begin{proof}
			The minimal polynomial of $A$, $x^2+1$ splits completely into distinct linear factors over $\complex$, $(x+i)(x-i)$, so $A$ is diagonalizable over $\complex$. The Jordan blocks of $A$ are all of size 1, so $A$ is similar to a diagonal matrix with an equal number of $i$'s and $-i$'s along the diagonal. 
		\end{proof}
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Let $G$ be a group of order 70. Prove that $G$ has a normal subgroup of order 35.
	\begin{proof}
		Any subgroup of $G$ with order 35 will be normal as it will have index 2. It then suffices to simply show that $G$ has a subgroup of order 35.\\

		\noindent $70 = 2\cdot 5\cdot 7$. By Sylow's theorem, the number of Sylow-7 subgroups, $n_7$ is 1 mod 7 and divides $2\cdot 5 = 10$. The only possibility is $n_7 = 1$. Similarly we have that $n_5 = 1$ as well. Since the Sylow-$p$ subgroups are conjugate to one another, the fact that we have unique Sylow-5 and Sylow-7 subgroups shows that these subgroups, $H$ and $K$, are normal in $G$. Consequently, the product subgroup $HK$ is a subgroup of $G$ with order
		\[
		|HK| = \frac{|H|\cdot |K|}{|H\cap K|}.
		\]
		Since $H$ and $K$ are cyclic with relatively prime orders they must intersect trivially, so $|HK| = 35$.
	\end{proof}

	\item Construct a Galois extension $F$ of $\rationals$ satisfying $\Gal(F/\rationals)\cong D_8$.
	\begin{solution}
		Consider the splitting field of $p(x) = x^4-2$ over $\rationals$. $p$ has roots $i^k2^{1/4}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$, so $F = \rationals(2^{1/4}, i)$. $\rationals(2^{1/4})$ is a real degree 4 subextension. $[\rationals(2^{1/4}, i): \rationals(2^{1/4})]=2$, so we have that $[\rationals(2^{1/4}, i):\rationals] = 8$. Since $\Gal(F/\rationals)$ is the Galois group of a degree-4 polynomial, it must be a subgroup of $S_4$. Any order 8 subgroup of $S_4$ is one of its (all isomorphic) Sylow-2 subgroups. The dihedral group $D_8$ is an order 8 subgroup of $S_4$, so we must have that $\Gal(F/\rationals)\cong D_8$.
	\end{solution}

	\item Let $F$ be a field. Prove that every ideal of $F[x]$ is principal.
	\begin{proof}
		Let $I$ be a nonzero proper ideal of $F[x]$ and let $a$ be an element of $I$ of minimal degree. If $\deg a = 0$ then $a$ is a unit, in which case $I = F[x]$. We claim that $a$ divides every element of $I$, so since $(a)$ is clearly contained in $I$, we'll have that $I = (a)$. Let $b$ be any element of $I$. Since $F$ is a field we can perform polynomial division with remainder to obtain unique $q$ and $r$ with $b = aq+r$, where $r$ is either zero or has degree strictly less than that of $a$. $r$ cannot have degree strictly less than that of $a$ because $a$ was chosen to have minimal degree, so we must have that $r=0$ and $a$ divides every element of $I$.
	\end{proof}

	\item Give an example of a module $M$ over a ring $R$ such that $M$ is not finitely generated as an $R$-module.
	\begin{proof}
		Any infinitely generated abelian group will do the trick, e.g. $\bigoplus_{\naturals}\integers$. Abelian groups are $\integers$-modules, so an infinitely generated abelian group is not a finitely generated $\integers$-module.\\

		\noindent Suppose $\bigoplus_\naturals\integers$ is finitely generated. Elements of this module are of the form $(a_i)_{i=1}^\infty$ where all but finitely many of the $a_i$ are zero. If we could find a finite generating set of this module, there would be some maximal $N$ with $a_N$ nonzero an $a_j = 0$ for all $j>N$ and all generators $(a_i)$. But $\bigoplus_\naturals\integers$ clearly contains elements where $a_j\neq 0$ for $j>N$, so this module cannot be finitely generated.
	\end{proof}
\end{enumerate}
