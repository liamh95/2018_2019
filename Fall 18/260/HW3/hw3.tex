\noindent\textbf{Problem 1. }
Let $(b_1, b_2, \ldots)$ be a sequence of complex numbers such that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_nc_n$ is convergent for every $c = (c_1, c_2, \ldots)\in \ell^2$. Show that $b\in \ell^2$.
\begin{proof}
	Consider the sequence of maps $T_n: \ell^2\to \complex$ that send $(c_1, \ldots)$ to $\sum_{j=1}^n b_jc_j$. Since each $T_n$ is just a finite sum, we have that the $T_n$'s form a sequence of bounded linear operators on $\ell^2$. Furthermore, this sequence is pointwise bounded: given any $(c_1, c_2, \ldots)\in \ell^2$, since $\sum_{j=1}^\infty b_jc_j$ converges, we have that the sequence of partial sums $|T_n(c_1, c_2, \ldots)| = |\sum_{j=1}^n b_jc_j|$ is bounded. By the uniform boundedness principle, we have that
	\[
	\sup_{n\in \naturals,\ \|(c_1, c_2, \ldots)\|_2 = 1}|T_n(c_1, c_2, \ldots)| = \sup_{n\in \naturals}\|T_n\| = \sum_{j=1}^\infty |b_j|<\infty,
	\]
	so $(b_1, b_2, \ldots)\in \ell^2$.
\end{proof}

\noindent\textbf{Problem 2. }
Let $M$ be a measurable subset of $\reals^n$ with finite positive measure. Prove that $L^q(M)$ is of the first category in $L^p(M)$ if $1\leq p<q\leq \infty$.
\begin{proof}
	Since $M$ has finite measure, we have that $L^q(M)\subseteq L^p(M)$ whenever $1\leq p<q\leq \infty$. Consider the injection $\iota: L^q(M)\to L^p(M)$ that simply sends $f\in L^p(M)$ to itself. By the generalized H\"older inequality we have that $\Lp{\iota(f)}{p} = \Lp{f}{p}\leq \mu(M)^{1/r}\Lp{f}{q}$, where $\frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{q} + \frac{1}{r}$. This shows that $\iota$ is bounded, and therefore continuous. Since $L^p(M)$ and $L^q(M)$ are Banach spaces, the open mapping theorem tells us that the image of $\iota$ is either surjective and open or of the first category in $L^p(M)$.\\

	\noindent Our plan is to show that $\iota$ is \textit{not} surjective, i.e. that $L^p(M)\setminus L^q(M)$ is nonempty. We'll do this by showing that $L^q(M) = L^p(M)$ would forbid the existence of subsets of $M$ with arbitrarily small measure. Since sets of positive measure in $\mathbb{R}^n$ \textit{do} contain sets of arbitrarily small measure, we'll conclude that $L^q(M)\neq L^p(M)$.\\

	\noindent If the embedding $\iota: L^q(M)\to L^p(M)$ were surjective, then the open mapping theorem would imply that $\iota$ is actually a homeomorphism. In particular, its inverse, $\iota': L^p(M)\to L^q(M)$ is a bounded operator. Let $A$ be a subset of $M$ with positive, finite measure and define the function
	\[
	f_A(x) = \frac{1}{m(A)^{1/p}}\cdot \chi_A(x).
	\]
	It's clear that $\Lp{f_A}{p} = 1$ and that $\Lp{f_A}{q} = \frac{1}{m(A)^{1/p-1/q}}$. Since $\iota'$ is bounded, we have
	\[
	0<\Lp{f_A}{q} \leq \|\iota'\|\cdot \Lp{f_A}{p} \implies 0<\frac{1}{\|\iota'\|^{\frac{pq}{q-p}}}\leq m(A).
	\]
	This puts a positive lower bound on the measure of subsets of $M$. But $M$, as a subset of $\reals^n$ with positive measure, contains set of arbitrarily small measure. We conclude that $L^q(M)$ is of the first category of $L^p(M)$.
\end{proof}


\noindent\textbf{Problem 3. }
Let $(X, \mcal{A}, \mu)$ be a finite measure space. Assume that $E$ is a closed subspace of $L^2(X, \mu)$, and that $E$ is contained in $L^\infty(X, \mu)$. Prove that $E$ is finite dimensional.
\begin{proof}
	By H\"older's inequality, the embedding $\iota: L^\infty(X)\to L^2(X)$, $f\mapsto f$ is continuous, i.e., $\Lp{f}{\infty}\leq C\cdot \Lp{f}{2}$ for some finite $C>0$. Let $e_1, \ldots e_n$ be an orthonormal set in $E$. 
\end{proof}
