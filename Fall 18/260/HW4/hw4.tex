\noindent\textbf{Problem 1. }Let $E$ and $F$ be two Banach spaces, and let $T\in \mcal{L}(E,F)$. Prove that $\img(T)$ is closed if and only if there exists a constant $C>0$ such that
\[
\dist(x, \ker T)\leq C\cdot \|Tx\|,\quad \forall x\in E.
\]
\begin{proof}
	% By passing to $E/\ker T$, we can assume that $T$ is injective. In this setting, we're trying to show that the image of $T$ is closed if and only if there is some positive $C$ such that
	% \[
	% \|x\|\leq C\cdot \|Tx\|
	% \]
	% for all $x\in E$. If the image of $T$ is closed, then $F/\img T$ is a Banach space
	First suppose that the given inequality holds for some $C>0$. Let $Tx_n$ be a convergent sequence in the image of $T$. Then the sequence of $x_n+\ker T$'s converges in the quotient $E/\ker T$ by the given inequality. Since $T$ is continuous, $\ker T$ is closed and the quotient $E/\ker T$ is complete. Thus, $x_n+\ker T$ converges to some $x+\ker T$. By continuity, $Tx_n$ then converges to $Tx$, which is in the image of $T$. Thus, the image of $T$ is closed.\\

	\noindent Conversely, suppose that $\img(T)$ is closed. 
\end{proof}

\noindent\textbf{Problem 4. }
Let $E = L^p(0,1)$ with $1\leq p<\infty$. Given $u\in E$, set
\[
Tu(x) = \int_0^xu(t)\ dt.
\]
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item Prove that $T:E\to E$ is compact.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{Problem 5. }
Let $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ be three Banach spaces with norms $\|\cdot \|_X$, $\|\cdot \|_Y$, and $\|\cdot \|_Z$. Assume that $X\subseteq Y$ with compact injection and that $Y\subseteq Z$ with continuous injection. Prove that for any $\epsilon>0$ there exists $C_\epsilon\geq 0$ such that
\[
\|u\|_Y\leq \epsilon\|u\|_X+C_\epsilon\|u\|_Z
\]
for all $u\in X$.
\begin{proof}
	Suppose the proposition were false: that for some $\epsilon$ and for every $C\geq 0$ there exists a $u_C$ such that
	\[
	\|u_C\|_Y> \epsilon\|u_C\|_X+C\|u_C\|_Z
	\]
	for all $x\in X$. Set $C = n$ and let $u_n$ be a sequence in $X$ such that the above equality holds, i.e.
	\begin{equation}\label{contra_ineq}
	\|u_n\|_Y > \epsilon \|u_n\|_X + n\|u_n\|_Z.
	\end{equation}
	We can assume without loss of generality that the sequence $u_n$ has norm 1 in $X$, since replacing $u_n$ with $\frac{u_n}{\|u_n\|_X}$ gives the same inequality after multiplying through by $\|u_n\|_X$. By the compactness of the injection of $X$ into $Y$, we have that $u_n$ has a convergent subsequence in $Y$. Without loss of generality, assume then that $u_n$ converges in $Y$. Rearranging (\ref{contra_ineq}) gives
	\begin{gather*}
	n\|u_n\|_Z < \|u_n\|_Y - \epsilon \|u_n\|_X \leq \|u_n\|_Y
	\\ \iff
	\|u_n\|_Z <\frac{1}{n}\|u_n\|_Y.
	\end{gather*}
	\noindent Since $u_n$ converges in $Y$, the right-hand side of the above inequality must go to zero. Since $Y$ continuously embeds into $Z$ and $u_n$ converges in $Y$, we must have that $u_n$ converges to zero in both $Y$ and $Z$. But then the left-hand side of (\ref{contra_ineq}) will tend to 0 and the right-hand side will tend to $\epsilon$: a contradiction. We conclude that the proposition is true.\\

	\noindent In class we showed (using the Arzela-Ascoli theorem) that $C^1([0,1])$ compactly embeds into $C([0,1])$. We also have that $C([0,1])$ continuously embeds into $L^1([0,1])$ by $\int_0^1|f|\ dx \leq \|f\|_\infty$. By the proposition we then have that for all $\epsilon>0$ there is some $C_\epsilon$ with
	\[
	\max_{x\in [0,1]}|f(x)| \leq \epsilon\cdot \max_{x\in [0,1]}|f'(x)| + C_\epsilon\Lp{f}{1}
	\]
	for all $f\in C^1([0,1])$.
\end{proof}
